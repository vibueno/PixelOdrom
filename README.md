## Description

pixelOdrom is a web tool for creating pixel art. This project was developed within the frame of the Front End Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity and greatly improved afterwards.

## Live

For a live version of pixelOdrom, visit [GitHub Pages](https://vibueno.github.io/pixelodrom).

## Libraries

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
- [jQuery Awesome Cursor](https://jwarby.github.io/jquery-awesome-cursor)
- [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com)
- [jQuery Colorpicker](http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)

## Design

- Mobile first: the styles included in the file styles.css are optimized for a minimum width of 240px. The file responsiveness.css builds on styles.css by providing additional styles which make the site work correctly on bigger viewports.

## Programming

- Fully responsive (starting at 240px of _Unihertz Jelly Pro_, as fas as I know the smallest Smartphone widely available)
- jQuery Event Delegation
- JavaScript Promises

## Usage

- Select the width and height and create a new canvas
- Select a color with the color picker
- Paint pixels by clicking on them. You can also paint more then one pixel in one stroke by dragging the mouse
- You may reset pixel colors by using the erase tool. Dragging function works for erasing too

### Saving canvas

You can save a canvas for working on it later on. In order to do that, click on the save button at the bottom of the canvas.

### Loading a previously saved canvas

You can load a canvas file by clicking on the folder icon in the main toolbar.

### Exporting canvas as an image

You can export a canvas as an image file by clicking on the image button at the bottom of your canvas.

## Samples

In the folder [samples](https://github.com/vibueno/PixelOdrom/tree/master/pixelart/img), you can find art made with PixelOdrom

## Improvements

- Make possible to draw pixel lines on mobile
- Selectable brush size
- Replacing colors on canvas (it could be helpful if you have a big surface painted with one color and you decide to change it)

- Create class pixelCanvas
- Add Unit testing

## Issues

- Image download on _DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser_ on mobile does not seem to work correctly
- Sometimes there is a short delay on certain computers when painting pixels, or some pixels dissapear.

## Tests

- Desktop computer + Developer Tools
- Uniherz Jelly Pro
